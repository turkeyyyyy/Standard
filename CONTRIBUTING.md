# Contributing to JSON Agents

Thank you for your interest in improving **JSON Agents** — the open specification for defining portable AI agents.

This document explains how to propose changes, report issues, and contribute new content to the repository.

## 📜 Guiding Principles

1. **Neutrality:**  
   JSON Agents aims to remain framework-agnostic and vendor-neutral.

2. **Clarity over complexity:**  
   Favor explicit field definitions, clear JSON examples, and human-readable schema descriptions.

3. **Backward compatibility:**  
   All revisions should strive to remain compatible with previously valid manifests whenever possible.

4. **Extensibility:**  
   Use the `extensions` or `x-*` namespaces for experimentation and forward-looking ideas.

## 🧭 Ways to Contribute

- **Improve documentation:** fix typos, clarify examples, or improve formatting.  
- **Propose schema changes:** add or refine properties in the JSON Schema.  
- **Suggest new profiles:** expand functionality while keeping the core minimal.  
- **Add examples:** new agent configurations, tool schemas, or graph topologies.  
- **Discuss interoperability:** map how existing frameworks could align with JSON Agents.

## ⚙️ Development Setup

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-change
````

3. Make your edits and run a JSON Schema validation test:

   ```bash
   npm install -g ajv-cli
   ajv validate -s schema/json-agents.json -d examples/*.json
   ```
4. Commit and push your changes:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Update schema: added 'metrics_enabled' property"
   git push origin feature/your-change
   ```
5. Open a pull request describing your proposal.

---

## 🧪 Validation

All pull requests must include:

* A **valid JSON Schema** that passes `ajv` validation.
* Updated or new **examples** demonstrating your change.
* A note in `CHANGELOG.md` summarizing the update.
